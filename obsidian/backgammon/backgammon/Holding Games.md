Between two strong players, most games turn into holding games.

A one way holding game is where one player escapes to the midpoint or beyond and the other player has a high anchor, usually 18 or 20.

A mutual holding game is where both sides have high anchors.

Guidelines:

1) When ahead, break contact. When behind, keep contact.
2) If you are ahead, try to break points when your opponent's home board is vulnerable especially if it looks to get better with time.
3) Keep a strong home board as long as possible.
4) Don't double without a solid race lead.

Notes:

Throwing a big double in a close mutual holding game almost always means running your back anchor.

When you are way ahead, look for a good time to break contact.

In a really bad holding game, play to maintain contact as much as possible.

Blocking points in front of opponent's anchor should not be broken to hit loose behind it unless you have no choice.

If bearing in is going to be tough, watch for a weakness in opponent's home board and go then.

In mutual holding game, the general strategy is play safe, wait for a double and let your opponent take risks.

With many men back on both sides, avoid big stacks. Keep position flexible.

In a long holding game, it's better not to have anchors too close together controlling the same area.

Leave blots only because you must.

Breaking up a home board is the last resort. Hold off as long as possible.

In a mutual holding game, try to move from the back.

Try to have plenty of spares to give you maximum flexibility.

A 30 pip lead is worth a double in most holding games.

When a close holding game leads to a direct shot, it may be time to double.
