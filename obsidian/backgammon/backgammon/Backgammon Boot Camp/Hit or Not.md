First look at plays that either make a point or hit a blot. Better if it does both. Unless a roll does neither, the best play will probably be one of those.

More often than not, it is better to hit a blot than make a point. And usually the best blot to hit is the one that gets sent furthest back. Backgammon is a [[Racing]] game at the core.

Probably the most important consideration is relative board strength. With more board points than opponent you tend to hit. With less you tend to play safe.

Here the correct play is bar/20 6/5*. This is not about the race it is an [[Initiative]] hit. This makes it harder for white to escape or make an advanced anchor and if missed black has a good chance to make the 5 point.
