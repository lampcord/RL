An action double is a double based on the chance to hit an opponent at a time where it will massively tilt the game in your favor. You don't even need to be a favorite to hit if the hit will give you a great chance for a win or gammon.

Notes:

The more solid your opponent's position, the more threats you need to justify doubling.

Just because you have a couple of shots doesn't mean you have an action double. You need to see what the result of hitting will do.
