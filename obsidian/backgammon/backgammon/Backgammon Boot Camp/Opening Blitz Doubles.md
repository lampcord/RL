This kind of position occurs when one player splits early and the other player rolls a 33, 44 or 55 that allows them to make two point and hit. If the first player dances, we have an opening blitz double decision.

Black is the favorite. A lot of black's wins will be doubles especially if he has a closeout. White still has a decent chance for a win. This is a double/take and white's equity after a take is about -.900.
Black wins a single 37%, double 30%, loses 33%. The only reason this is a take is because cube ownership is huge in these kinds of volatile positions.

Black split +
White covered a blot -
Black brought down an extra builder +

Now it's not even a double! That 5 point is huge.
Differences:
Black split +
No white blot -
Black extra builder +
White 5 point --

Those extra builders and made 8 point tip the scales so far back that it is now a mild drop.
