In middlegames, you are constantly faces with situations where you need to decide whether it is better to go forward and try to outrun your opponent or drop back into a [[Backgame]].

Black's 4 prime is just as good as whites. His timing is not nearly as good. He should hit with the 1 and play 13/11 trying to win a priming game. If he can escape some of his back checkers the fact that he is behind should give him an advantage. [[Priming]]

The obvious play here is 13/8* 10/8 making a 5 prime. But it is better to make the bold play (since he has more men back) 13/8* 5/2. If hit, the back game is still in play and he has strong chances to make the 5 prime anyway if not while white has 2 on the bar.

Playing for the backgame here is a bad idea. Moves like 8/3* 6/5* and then hoping to holdout while white moves all of his checkers around is very unlikely. The only way a back game can work for black here is if he can recirculate his checkers and white's 5 prime makes that difficult.
The best move here is 23/17 15/14*. It safely gets a checker out into play and white will be reluctant to hit lose and break his prime. He should play to win forward.

Black should come in on the 22. With 2 forward anchors, he isn't committed yet to a backgame. And with 2 blots in the home board and 2 places to land safely, he can play boldly and purely. 9/5 slotting the 5 point is best.

This is one the author got wrong because of the weakness of the computers when his book was written. The best move by far is bar/22 24/22. The 3 point anchor is extremely powerful!
