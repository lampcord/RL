A collection of one off positions that don't fall into normal categories.

Notes:

If you have to leave a shot at the end of a game where getting hit will probably cost you the game, leave as few shots as possible.

When your opponent's board is strong and yours is weak, survival is the top priority.

Go for a gammon when the downside risk is small.

Always remember that winning over losing is twice as valuable as winning a gammon over a single.

This is a common situation. White on the bar with a 5 point board and a high point open. Black can double if he's closer than 10 pips in the race. White can take if black is not solidly (10% ?) ahead.
