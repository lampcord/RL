A post blitz turnaround is a position where you've survived a blitz either by making an anchor or escaping and you are in the process of priming your opponent's back men.

These positions are very dangerous for both sides.

Advantages for the blitzing side include a strong board and usually a good racing lead.

The survivor's greatest strength will come from building a strong prime. They also usually hold the cube because they were just being blitzed. It is difficult to determine when it is strong enough to cube.

Notes:

Catching your opponent on the bar is usually a good time to double.

When you're in trouble after any play, attack.

Always remember your roll comes in two parts. Look at both separately, you may see a move you would have otherwise missed.
