Diversification is leaving your checkers so that you have as many good rolls as possible.

Black wants to escape his back men or make a forward anchor. If he plays bar/20 then all of his even numbers are good but all of his odd numbers are bad (blocked). There is only a 25% chance of rolling 2 even numbers. OTOH if black plays bar/23 24/21, he has a lot of good rolls because some are even numbers away from white and some are odd. This is diversification, leaving more good die rolls by spreading your checkers around. 

The opposite of diversification is [[Duplication]].
