[[Backgame Cube Action II]]
The classic beginner mistake is that when he gets a double shot he immediately turns the cube. Favored to hit does not necessarily mean favored to win.

Amazingly, this IS NOT A DOUBLE! This is actually a [[Beaver]]! There is a 25% chance that white doesn't get hit. He has already borne off so he can't lose a double. He is very unlikely to leave a second blot and if he gets hit he's losing but he isn't lost. Black is better off waiting on the cube so till after he hits.

This OTOH is a double and drop! Why? White has not borne off and could lose a double. There are two blots instead of 1 and white's stripped 8 point could lead to even more.
