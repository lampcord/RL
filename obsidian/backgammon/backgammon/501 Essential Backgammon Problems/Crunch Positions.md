A crunch position is one where your board has collapsed before you have escaped your back checkers. Once this happens, you need to race your back men as quickly as possible because your board won't be much of a threat anymore. 

A good rule of thumb is to double as soon as your opponent's home board collapses. Even if it isn't actually a good double, you will pick up a lot of free games that way.

Notes:

When your opponent is under pressure, don't let him off the hook by running instead of keeping contact.

Beware of taking when your front has collapsed and the game is far from finished.
