These rolls can make a point in the opening:
31, 42, 53, 64, 61 although 64 is often played differently.

31 is generally better than 61 because of the fact that it allows you to [[unstack]] the 6 point and makes a home board point. The advantage of the 61 is that it blocks 6's from your opponents 1 point and makes it tougher to run out.

Making a point with 64 in the opening was once considered a blunder. But now it is considered only a minor error in most games but possibly best if playing for a gammon.
