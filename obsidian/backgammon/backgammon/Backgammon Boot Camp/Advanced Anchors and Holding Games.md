Black can play 13/7 13/8 and [[volunteer]] a hit. If he doesn't get hit (11/32 chances) he would probably have an easy win. This would be a big mistake since he can avoid this without breaking his board by playing 8/2 6/5 instead. Black has a big lead so he just wants to avoid a hit.

With a 41 you want to play 6/1 NOT 8/3! You want to [[save a six]] to help keep you from having to leave a shot later.

In this position, it's better to play 13/7 13/8 because White's board is weak and he has a blot in his home board so the risk of being hit now is much less than holding on and letting White cover and build his home board. This is an important concept in [[pay now or pay later]] scenarios.
