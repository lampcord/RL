These are observations by the author of consistently successful tournament players.
1) **Confidence** - Humans are not good at holding 2 ideas simultaneously. Expecting to win helps you see your way there over the board. 
2) **Respect** - Always expect your opponent to put up a fight and expect a serious struggle. Some of my worst games have been against bad players.
3) **Consistency** - Pace yourself and put up equal effort from the beginning to the end of tournaments.
4) **Stamina** - Being well rested and not stuffed full of high carb food can help you stay focused.
5) **Engagement** - Winners do not exhibit Zen like detachment. Instead they are emotionally engaged in the match. When winning they look pleased and when loosing they look like a defensive lineman on the 5 yard line ready to fight.
6) **Deliberateness** - Winners tend to play at a deliberate, consistent pace. Never making snap moves but also never dwelling forever and using up their clock.
7) **Decisiveness** - Winners also don't play slowly and indecisively. They size up the position, look at their options, then make what they thing is the best move. And don't dwell on previous mistakes.
8) **Inner-DIrectedness** - Winners don't play to impress the people around them. They aren't afraid of making an unpopular move if they think it's right. And they don't care what onlookers think of their play.
