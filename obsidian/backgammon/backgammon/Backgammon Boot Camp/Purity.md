Purity means keeping as many checkers alive and active as possible to build key points or to defend against bad rolls that will wreck your position.

Pure plays tend to build primes and discount safety and the race.

White has a lot of checkers back so by rule (6) form [[Bold or Safe Plays]] hitting is less important and by rule 7 bold play is still valid. So the best play here is 8/5 6/5.This leaves 3 blots but white has a very weak prime and so many checkers back that it will be very difficult to contain any checkers he hits.
