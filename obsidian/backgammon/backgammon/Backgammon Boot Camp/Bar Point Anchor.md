The bar point anchor (7 point) has advantages and disadvantages over the 5 point. 
Pros:
1) It is farther advanced.
2) A single checker can usually move to safety with a single 5 to the midpoint.
3) You will never find yourself behind a 6 prime from there.
Cons:
1) It does not prevent other checkers from being shut out.
2) It allows the opponents home board to be built in peace behind it.
