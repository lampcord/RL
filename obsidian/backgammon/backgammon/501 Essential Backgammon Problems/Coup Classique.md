A coup classique is a special case of the [[Ace Point Games]] where you can get a shot at 2 opponents checkers and possibly win.

In this position, if white rolls any non double, black gets a shot and any non double 1 leaves 2 shots. It is definitely worth staying back for the shots here.

If white has only 2 back, black should definitely run to save the double if he can get out on this roll. If you can't get out, you should stay and play for the one possible shot even though it probably only saves the double.

If white has 5 checkers, black should definitely stay back.

With 4 checkers, black should run.
