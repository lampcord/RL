As long as white can't escape with a direct roll, slot the back and cover until you have a six prime. If white moves up to where it can jump the prime then you must hit, making a point if possible but hit loose otherwise. This is [[Hitting off the edge]]

It is usually a mistake to weaken your prime in the process of hitting off the edge but sometimes switching points can be necessary to prevent the checker from escaping.
