If playing on means you have more than twice the chance of winning a double as losing then you should play on instead of doubling.

Example:
40% win, 40% double, 20% loss

.4 + .8 -.2 == 1.0 which is the push point for doubling.

This is a well timed ace point game. Black wins about 64% single, 20% double, 16% loss. This is a huge drop for white.  There are only 3 rolls that leave a shot, 55, 65. Out of those he would get hit once out of times (3 x 11 / 36). So even though black doesn't have nearly 2 doubles for every loss, he should play on because he can use the cube later if things get a little worse.

This is terrible spare distribution. Black leaves a shot with 66, 65, 64, 63, 61, 54, 44, 43. That's 14 shots! Giving black 4.3 hits. But it's worse than that since only a few rolls (mostly small doubles) really improve the position so he could be facing this on multiple turns. So white has a take here.

White is down 39 pips and has limit prospects for a flyer. He is so far down that even big dubs don't catch him up. This is a clear drop for white. But if you move just 2 checkers from the 13 to 6 point giving him a 4 point prime and only trailing by 25, it's just good enough to take.

The fact that black has a checker back that white can attack is enough play for white to take here.
White is one step away from a drop, meaning one good roll by black and he would drop. 65, 63, 54, 33, 44, 66, 11 would all be market losers. 10 rolls plus a lot of pretty good ones.

[[General Principles]] One of the biggest faults in lower level players is to wait till all counterplay has been eliminated before doubling. This leads to huge PR losses as you get dinged every turn you don't turn the cube and then when you do double, it is often too late and your opponent drops.
Backgammon rewards risk and a degree of boldness is required.
