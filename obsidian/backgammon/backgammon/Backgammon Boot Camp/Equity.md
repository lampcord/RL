Equity is the expected value of a position. Positive equity means that side is winning and negative losing. Equity > 1.00 means the position is worth more than a game, probably because of gammon chances. It is usually a mistake to [[double]] when your equity is > 1.00 because your opponent can pass and you will lose value.

On the last roll of the game, you can calculate the probability of winning by counting the rolls that win and dividing by 36.

Equity is the fair value of the game. On the final roll the rollers equity is the probability of winning - the probability of losing multiplied by the stake.

In this position, black has 19 rolls that win and 17 that lose. His equity is:

But if the cube were at 4 it would be .222 for example.
