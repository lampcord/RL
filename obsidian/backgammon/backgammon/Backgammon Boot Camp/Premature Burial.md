Premature Burial refers to burying checkers to deep to ever be of use again. When you make the 1 point, you will never be able to use those checkers until you bear off. That means you are down 15 checkers to 13 the rest of the game which is a huge disadvantage.

The fewer checkers you have the fewer options you have on each roll and that increases the chance that you will be forced to play move you don't want to.

The opposite of premature burial is [[Purity]]

[[Backgammon Boot Camp]]
