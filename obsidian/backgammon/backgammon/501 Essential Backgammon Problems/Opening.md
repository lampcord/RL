The opening is the most important and difficult part of the game. Whatever happens here sets the stage for the rest of the game and it is something you will face every game.

The key is balance.

Pointers:

1) Don't stack checkers to be safe. 
2) If your opponent splits to your 4 or 5 point, you want to attack him.
3) The two major goals are hitting and making points.
4) Hitting is usually a little more important than making a point.
5) If you have a choice of points to make, do the one that is most important for the current position.
6) If you have to leave a blot, slot the most valuable point.
7) When under pressure, look for a hit that will take away part of opponent's roll.
8) Don't strip your midpoint.
9) Prime 2 checkers, attack 1.

More notes:

The 5 point is the most important point in the early game.

Fight for the 4-5 point. Be reluctant to hit the 3. Only hit the 1 or 2 if absolutely necessary.

It's even better to slot against one blot because if you are hit, there is no danger of your opponent making a point there.

If you have a move that is both powerful and difficult to do in the opening, it is almost certainly the right move.

Putting 2 checkers on the bar is very powerful in the opening. It means your opponent will need his whole roll just to get in and could start a blitz.

Inner board points are stronger than outer board points,

A prime isn't as good against a single checker because it can escape with 1 lucky roll and it can't anchor. Blitzing is more effective.

When you hit on an opponent's slot, you generally want to stay on it and create an anchor there.

When you have a choice of moving a blot to one of the bar points, the opponent's bar is usually the right choice.

Hitting on the ace point with a 5 is usually only good when you have a big stack on your 6 point and your opponent has a lot of threats.

If you do hit on the ace point and leave a blot, you usually want to cover it as soon as possible. It's still an inner point and it can sometimes force opponent to play an uncomfortable 1 when coming in.

If you hold your opponent's bar point, you generally want to stay on it until you've built a powerful home board. Then when you run, it will be very risky for opponent to hit you if he has to leave shots.

A blot in your opponent's board is a sign that you can play more aggressively.

Stripping the midpoint early should be avoided. You want a spare there to hit a runner without having to give up the midpoint.

Put your blots in front of stripped points, not stacks! This means if you are hit, your opponent will often have to leave a blot. If you are hit from a stack you are letting your opponent do 2 good things at once.

You need to take some chances in the opening to build a good prime. Builders in the outfield that require indirect shots are a good gamble.

An early 66 usually gives you the choice of running or attacking.  Use the attack 1 prime 2 rule as always.

Don't bother fighting for the 5 point if it is very unlikely to work. For example if you have very few builders to follow it up.

Our goal is balance. Improve the part of your game that is in most need of help.
