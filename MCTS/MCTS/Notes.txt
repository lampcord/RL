This feels like a lot of resources for minimal improvement.

Obviously, this is much more effective than combining multiple runs.

Things to look at:
1) Multithreading
2) Temporal Decay (100s +.5) / 101 => (s + .005) * 100/101 
   Note: We may not need extra mini-minmax if TD works.
3) Add call to intrinsic function for get_num_moves. Used in a lot of performance critical places.
4) Changing from pass by reference to returning tuple.
5) Instead of passing node id to rollout, can we just pass the position, player_to_move and result?
   This would eliminate the uneeded access to the node storage.
6) Look into 'striping' the node class if there is a way to isolate information only needed in some areas.
