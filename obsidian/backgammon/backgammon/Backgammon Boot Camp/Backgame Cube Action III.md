[[Backgame Cube Action II]]
The classic beginner mistake is that when he gets a double shot he immediately turns the cube. Favored to hit does not necessarily mean favored to win.

Amazingly, this IS NOT A DOUBLE! This is actually a [[Beaver]]! There is a 25% chance that white doesn't get hit. He has already borne off so he can't lose a double. He is very unlikely to leave a second blot and if he gets hit he's losing but he isn't lost. Black is better off waiting on the cube so till after he hits.

This OTOH is a double and drop! Why? White has not borne off and could lose a double. There are two blots instead of 1 and white's stripped 8 point could lead to even more.

This is already a big drop for white. Even though black only has 1 shot right now with 18 shots, he has a solid 5 prime, and most importantly the 6 and 8 points of white will be major liabilities going forward. Even the blot on 14 would come in handy if white escaped the prime.

A few small changes tilt the game to a solid take for white. The blot in black's home board and the fact that black's prime is only a 4 makes it much easier for white to jump the prime which greatly reduces the chances of having to break the 6 and 8.
