You want to have all 15 of your checkers working together. Checkers that are cut off from the rest are a weakness. Both players start the game in that situation.

Some plays that help keep your army connected look risky but are necessary.  Getting stragglers cut off is very dangerous.

Notes:

To play well, you need to develop a sense of problems before they occur and take measures to minimize them.

Three checkers back often work well together. They can cover more board and allow you to safely slot for a forward anchor while keeping your other anchor in tact.
