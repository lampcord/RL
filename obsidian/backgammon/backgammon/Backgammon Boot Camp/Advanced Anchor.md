High Anchors (4, 5 and sometimes bar point) are usually used for [[Holding Games]].
You can still race with a high anchor if you hit a [[Joker]] or you can stay back and wait for a shot. They also allow you to play much more aggressively because if you get hit somewhere else, the high anchor means you won't get shut out and you will usually be able to [[Recirculate]] the hit checker(s).
