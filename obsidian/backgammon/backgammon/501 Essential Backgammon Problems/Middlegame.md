Once both sides have made some inner points, you are out of the opening and into the middlegame. The basic goals are the same but stronger boards mean more danger to both sides.

Guidelines:
1) Fight for key points.
2) Favor inner board points over outer board points.
3) Try to get an advanced anchor before opponents board gets too strong.
4) Be eager to split if your opponent has an outer prime but a weak inner board.
5) Be reluctant to split if your opponent has a strong inner board or awkward stacks that he is going to want to unstack on you.
6) When your opponent's home board is weak, play boldly. When strong play safe.
7) Prime an anchor, attack a blot.
8) Double hits are even more powerful when you have built some home board.
9) Once you escape and take a lead, play safe.

Doubling guidelines:
1) Are you ahead in the race?
2) Is your inner board better?
3) Do you have an advanced anchor or escaped?
4) Does your opponent have blots?

If you are ahead in a couple and even in others you probably have a double / take.
If you are ahead in all, you probably have a double / pass.

Rules for hitting on the ace point:
1) Be reluctant to hit on the ace especially if you have no board or the position is complicated.
2) If you do hit on the ace point, be eager to cover it instead of leaving a blot around for later.

Once your opponent has started to block your back checkers, you should use non constructive rolls to escape. Every roll that doesn't build another point is a candidate to split or escape.

Once your opponent has an advanced anchor, you can't sit back on the 24 point. You have to build an anchor or run.

An advanced anchor plus a small blockade is enough for your opponent to double if you are stuck on the 24 point so get those back checkers moving.

If your opponent's structure is awkward, don't be in a hurry to split and give him targets.

If your opponent has a strong board, don't be in a hurry to split.

The ideal time to split is when your opponent has a prime plus a weak board.

If you only have one blot back and your opponent has a strong blocking position, there is no hurry to move up to the edge. This will just give opponent the chance to attack on the critical point.

If the race is close, don't stay back looking for a hit. Try to move up to a running position.

When you're playing with a straggler, keep out of trouble.

Don't provoke a fight when your opponent holds all the cards.

Beware of making your opponents good rolls even stronger.

If you are way behind in the race and your opponent is weak, you can afford to be very aggressive.

With a very strong board, don't be afraid to take some chances.

When your board is weaker, play safer.

Be reluctant to blitz if your opponent has a stronger board.

When you are blitzing and your opponent can't build an anchor, all inner board points are important. Even behind a blot.

If your opponent has anchored, blocking points behind the anchor are kind of useless.

Be prepared to switch game plans from move to move especially in tactical positions.

Don't build an outside prime once you've made low points in your board. Work on closing your board instead.

When your opponent has built an anchor, concentrate on building points in front of the anchor not attacking behind it.

When it's kill or be killed, kill.

When your opponent is ready to build on your head, distract with a hit.

In a bad position, use tempo hits.

When your opponent is on the bar, try to improve your position to the maximum amount possible.

Attacking on valuable points is much weaker if you have to attack with your last spare since you won't be able to cover the hit.

Don't overlook double hits. They can put much pressure on opponent. It can even outweigh a key defensive play.

Once you've escaped, fighting for key points goes way down in priority.

Escaping your back checkers is a worthy goal.

Use caution when leading in the race.

Don't get stuck in an ace or deuce point game without a fight.

Before you make an 'obvious' play, stop and look. Especially after you roll a double.

All else being equal, safety should always be a factor.

If you have the choice between two good things, do the harder one first.

Don't worry about opponent's miracle throws unless you have the game completely under control. Then, play to avoid them.

Move in front of stripped points and away from stacks.

Don't abandon your rear checker unless you have to.

Making a new blocking point usually is better than escaping unless you really need to escape.

Doubling from the bar requires very strong threats.

A lead in the race is not enough for a double unless you have some structure or have broken contact.

If your opponent has escaped and you have a straggler:
1) If the race is close, it's a take.
2) If you are behind by > 10%, it's a pass.

If you have a very strong position and your opponent doesn't have an anchor, you may have a double even without an strong threats.

A big lead can compensate for a lot of other weaknesses.

Beware of taking a double if there is a strong chance of losing a gammon if your opponent hits his threats.
