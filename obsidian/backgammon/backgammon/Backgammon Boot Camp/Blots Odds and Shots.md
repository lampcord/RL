Odds to get N numbers:
This is always 36 - (6-N)^2
1 - 11/36
2 - 20/36
3 - 27/36
4 - 32/36
5 - 35/36
6 - 36/36

Odds to hit N away:
1 - 11/36 (Any 1)
2 - 12/36 (Any 2 + 11)
3 - 14/36 (Any 3 + 11, 21)
4 - 15/36 (Any 4 + 11, 22, 31)
5 - 15/36 (Any 5 + 41, 32)
6 - 17/36 (Any 6 + 22, 33, 15, 24)
7 - 6 (16, 25, 34)
8 - 6 (26, 35, 22, 44)
9 - 5 (63, 54, 33)
10 - 3 (64, 55)
11 - 2 (65)
12 - 3 (33, 44, 66)
15 - 1 (55)
16 - 1 (44)
18 - 1 (66)
20 - 2 (55)
24 - 1 (66)

The lesson here is try to never leave direct shots. You are almost 3 times more likely to be hit 6 away as 7 away.

Notice 4 and 5 are the same chance which brings up this scenario:![[position_000015.png]]
Black has to play 18/12. Whether he uses his 1 to play 18/17 or not, he risks 5 hits. BUT, if he plays to 17 only 2 rolls won't hit or get past (21). At 18, 5 rolls won't hit (21, 31, 11).  That's 2 1/2 times more chances for White to leave a shot. If either side hits they are >90% to win.
