This is a middle game position where one side has a lot of checkers back and possibly more than one anchor. Not far enough back to be considered a [[Backgame]] but with a few bad rolls could become one or if things go the other way, it could turn into a [[Holding Games]].

This is a classic proto-backgame. Black has two excellent [[Anchors]] and is 71 pips back. He really wants to be closer to 90. He has a good [[Prime]] but does not have a [[Well Timed Position]]. He would like to either escape right away or fall further behind and wait.

Here is how he should play all of his rolls:
11 - The best roll partially because it is small.  Since black is not back far enough for a deep backgame he should play 23/21(2) and move up to a 34 game. This will help his bad timing by making the critical point earlier.
21 - 24/21 to avoid breaking his anchors.
31 - 24/21 22/21 similar to 11.
41 - Tough roll. 13/8 is best. Wouldn't mind getting hit.
51 - 24/18. Black doesn't mind getting hit at all which helps his timing and maybe even dancing.
61 - 24/18 again and the best 1 is 7/6 creating 3 builders for the next point.
22 - 23/21(2) for sure just like with the 11.  13/9 slots the next point and leaves a blot for white to hit.
32 - 24/21 23/21 again moving the anchors forward.
42 - 24/18. Again.
52 - 13/8 13/11.
62 - 24/18 of course. 13/11.
33 - 24/15 13/10 leaving white with 2 blots to hit.
43 - 24/21 13/9.
53 - 24/21 13/8.
63 - 24/15.
44 - Either 22/18(2) 8/4(2) to play a holding game or 8/4(2) 7/3(2).
54 - The ugly 13/8 13/19 preserving [[Purity]] which is very important in back games.
64 - 24/14.
65 - 24/13. If black's timing was worse, making the 18 point is optional.
66 - Worst nightmare. A sure drop after any play. 8/2(2) 24/18 13/7 is least bad.
