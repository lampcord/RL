41, 64, 63, 62, 51, 52 can all be used to bring down a builder and [[split]] the back men. ![[position_000013.png]]
This is the normal way to play a 41. The [[builder]] on 13/9 is particularly useful. From there you can build the 3, 4, 5, bar or 9 point depending on your next roll.

This is the weaker way to play the 43. There are far fewer ways to use the [[builder]] on the 10 point and the split to the 20 can walk into 31, 11, 33 all of which can be a huge setback.
