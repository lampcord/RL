Positions where both sides have effective primes are unstable and reach a crucial point quickly. If one side in an otherwise even game escapes a single checker it gives him such an advantage in timing and builders that the other player will often have to go to a different strategy.

Most would automatically complete the 5 prime here. But there are some problems with that. First of all, with an extra man back, black's timing is quite bad compared to white. Also, black's prime has very little mobility. Any checker he can't play from the back will break his board. But the biggest issue is the 4 anchor is an absolute must. Otherwise white will knock him off the edge and possibly even blitz. 24/22 23/21 13/11(2) is the right play. Making the 5 prime is actually -0.133!

Again, the obvious play is to make the bar point. But black will have a slightly weaker prime with slightly worse timing. And the more builders white brings down, the harder it will be to make the 4 anchor. So now is the time to push those back checkers. 24/22 23/21 13/9 still makes a good 9 point and gives black a good chance to make the anchor or even run.

A good rule is its usually better to do two good things instead of one even if that one is individually better than either of the other 2.

A lot of people would make the bar point with a hit and then either bring the 9 point in or run one or both of the back checkers. But by far the best (by -0.321!!) is the double hit 13/7(2)* 7/1(2)*.
