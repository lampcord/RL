After playing an [[Ace Point Games]] or [[Proto-Backgames]] and you get a hit, you are in a containment game.

You have 3 goals:

1) Prevent the checker you hit from getting back around. You need to control the outfield to get maximum shots at him.
2) Build a full 6 prime.
3) Roll the prime home and close him out.

The best way to contain the checker is to build a full prime and the best way to do that is slot the back.

Doubling is tricky here. The question to ask is, "If I roll my best numbers will my opponent still take?". If yes, hold the cube.

Notes:

When containing a checker, try not to give it a direct path to the outfield.

Don't let it escape with tempo.

Attack if he has a weak board, prime if it is strong.

If there is only 1 roll that can beat you, you should block it. Usually 66.

The ideal range for checkers waiting for a hit is 11-14 points from the checker. This gives maximum possibilities for a hit when it is forced to move forward.

When you get down to the last roll, double if you're a favorite.
