An anchor in your opponent's board is a strong asset. This includes the bar point. When to break it is a critical decision.

Here are some considerations:

1) Leading argues for running while trailing argues for staying back and waiting for a hit.
2) If you have other constructive plays, hold the anchor. If holding it will wreck your position, break it.
3) If one of your anchor checkers can run to a safe point like the midpoint, that's a good time to break it.
4) If you have stragglers behind the anchor, hold the anchor till you get them out.

Notes:

You can more safely break your anchor if there is no pressure on the blot you leave behind.
