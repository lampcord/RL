Once you have escaped one checker, the strategy changes a little for both sides.

You have a strong incentive to stay back out of harms way until you get a chance to run and your opponent has an incentive to blitz instead of prime.

Block 2 attack 1.

When you have trouble escaping, stay back and get as many checkers into your inner board as possible before you get closed out. This will save a lot of gammons.
