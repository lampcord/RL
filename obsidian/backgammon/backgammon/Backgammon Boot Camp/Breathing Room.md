This refers to a back checker being able to move out with a 5 or 6. For instance after a 61 makes the opponents bar point, your checkers on the 24 point can't play a 5 or 6 to get out. Splitting one of them to at least the 22 point allows the chance to jump that checker out or make the 22 point and have both of your checkers able to leave. This also protects against bad 6's and 5's in other sectors.
