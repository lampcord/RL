Flexibility is placing checkers so more of your future rolls will be good and more of your opponent's future rolls will be bad.

This can be broken down into 4 principles:
1) Diversification - placing your checkers so they will have the most possible ways to build a key point.
2) Unstacking - huge stacks mean a lot of checkers doing the work of a few. Unstacking is a key to building a stronger position.
3) Duplication - making rolls that are good for your opponent in one area also good in another. This limits the number of good rolls and forces him to make a choice when they get one of those rolls.
4) Slotting - putting a checker on a point you intend to make with the idea of covering it on the next turn.
