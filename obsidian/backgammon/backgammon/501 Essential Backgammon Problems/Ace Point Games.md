These are very common and you'll need to learn how to play both sides well.

Ace point games are games where you hold your opponent's ace point and he has built a prime and escaped his back checkers.

There are not many doubles in these situations. Usually if the priming side doubles, the defending side will gladly pass and get away cheap.

The exception is when the priming side has a bunch of gaps in his board. In these cases, it can even be a take if all other things are good for the defender.

Usually, the primer wants to clear from the back.

For the defender the questions are how do I build my prime in anticipation of a hit and when do I run to avoid a double.

If you are playing an ace point game and you hit a blot, you are now in a [[Containment Game]].

Notes:

When your opponent is on the ropes, hit him again!

When the game is under control, make sure to maximize your gammon chances. When doing so, keep the pressure on.

When your opponent is stuck in an ace point, hit all the blots you can.

When bearing in, don't automatically clear from the back. Breaking contact might be safer.

When bearing off, you usually want to clear from the back. If you can't do that, prepare to clear from the back.

Leaving a gap on the 5 point is often safer than clearing from the rear and leaving an odd number up front. But don't leave deeper gaps.

Even ended isn't always the safest play.

Don't try to save the gammon if it can't be saved. Stay back for the hit unless it would lead to a backgammon.

If the situation is hopeless, play to save the gammon.

At the end of the game, make sure to get all the shots you can.
