This is a method for adjusting the position count.
It is a model for [[Pipcount to Cube Action]]


Start with the pip count and then adjust for the following:

[[Checkers borne off]]
Add 1 for each checker borne off.

[[Crossovers]]
Add 1 for each extra crossover.

[[Stacks]]
Add 2 for every checker over 2 on 1 point.
Add 1 for every checker over 2 on 2 point.
Add 1 for every checker over 2 on 3 point.

[[Gaps]]
Add 1 for every gap on 4, 5, 6 point where opponent has a checker.

Take adjusted player's score / 6 and add to player's score.

Subtract opponent's score.

6 or less = double.
5 or less = redouble.
More than 2 = take.
