Sometimes things go very wrong and the best you can hope for is to save a gammon.

Rules:

1) Try to bear in exactly to the 6 point. That way you don't waste any pips.
2) Try to play as many crossovers with a roll as you can.
3) On the last roll, count the number of doubles that will allow you to save it.
4) Don't forget about backgammons!

Notes:

Once your opponent is down to 8 checkers or less, you want to bail out of his board and race home.
