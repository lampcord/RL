Most errors by intermediate players in [[Backgame]] positions come down to various forms of impure play.

[[Purity]] means keeping focused on mobility and construction of gapless primes. Avoiding [[Premature Burial]] at almost any cost and less concern about getting hit and falling behind.

Once a [[Backgame]] structure has formed, both players can feel comfortable playing bold and pure.
[[Prime]] building and the struggle for mobility are the primary concerns during backgame play.

Black's primary concern here is holding on to the 5 anchor and to [[Recirculate]] his checkers. If he has to break his 5, white will be able to massively improve his prime by filling it in. So black comes in with bar/5. As for the 2, the pure play is 9/7. Black is not afraid of being hit and he wants to fill the gap in his prime.

The correct move here is to break the 11 point and get some usable spares. 11/8 11/9. [[Mobility]].
This is much better than making the 1 point which not only buries a checker but completely strips all of the prime points making it very likely he will have to break it at some point.

Breaking the 3 anchor here would be a mistake that would have no chance of holding white back and at the same time allow white to fill in the 3 point greatly reducing the strength of black's back game. Instead the pure play again is 9/3 9/7 leaving 5 blots! Getting hit does not hurt black and this gives him a chance to extend the prime in either direction. Black gets away with this extremely loose play because of his 3 anchors, white's home board and white's premature burial on the 1 point.

The obvious looking 7/1* 3/1 is a huge blunder (-0.299)! Black doesn't have nearly enough material to make the attacking game work and should be priming instead. Again the pure move here is best, 16/8.
