Late game blitzes occur when one side gets caught without an anchor in the late middle game. These are harder to evaluate because the defender may have a well developed board. You need to be more willing to escape your back checkers in these positions and possibly switching to buy time to get them around.

Notes:

As in any blitz, low points may be more valuable than high ones.

Late blitzes can happen suddenly. Be alert that you aren't too good to double.

When the game is on the line, play to win.

When finishing off the blitz, don't overlook the switch. Especially if it will put a second checker on the bar and limit the chances of an opponent's deep anchor.
