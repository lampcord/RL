When you have a very strong game, don't be afraid to play aggressively for the gammon. A play that turns a single into a gammon picks up one point. But a play that turns a single into a loss loses 2. So you need to have twice as many chances to get the gammon as lose for the break even point.

Notes:

When you've been playing for a gammon and it looks like you're not going to make it, don't concede too quickly.

If a gammon chance presents itself, don't be afraid to go for it.

When in complete control, strike for the gammon in the most direct way possible.
