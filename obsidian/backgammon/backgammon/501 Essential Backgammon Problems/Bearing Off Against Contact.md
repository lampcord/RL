When you have almost won and you are just bearing off you have two goals:
1) Playing safe to avoid losing.
2) Putting yourself in the best position to win a gammon.

Notes:

When the game seems to be won, stay alert! There will still be non-trivial decisions to make.

When coming home against a single blot, don't overlook the switch move.

When bearing in, avoid putting checkers on your low points whenever possible.

When you have a closed board and you are bringing checkers around, make sure not to let big doubles break your board.

After a closeout and bringing in the last few checkers. Remember:
1) Arrange your checkers so a 66 won't break you.
2) Keep spread out for maximum flexibility.

When bearing off with a closed board against 1 or 2 checkers follow these rules:
1) Make sure a 66 won't leave a shot.
2) Keep your spares on separate points.
3) Before bearing off, try to get a spare to the 5 point.

If winning a gammon is possible and losing very unlikely, you should play very aggressively.

If a gammon is a lock, just make the safe play.

With more than 3 on the bar, the backgammon is very possible. Avoid playing too safely.

If you have closed out several checkers, the only way you can lose is to get hit. Clear from the rear as fast as possible so he can get in past you and never get a hit.
