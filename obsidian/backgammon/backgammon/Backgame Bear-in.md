[[Bearing In]] against a back game is similar to bearing in against a [[Deep Anchors]]. You want to clear from the back while avoiding gaps, keeping a flexible position and avoiding stacks.

[[Killing 6s]]. Black wants to play both back checkers up, either way is about the same, the key is to take away any 6s and slow himself down while hoping white breaks his board.

Black could play 8/3 8/4 which would be safest. But it allows white to escape some back spares and save his timing. Better is the [[Early Blot]] play 11/7 8/3. Even though this seems very dangerous, it will be extremely unlikely for white to jump blacks 5 prime in time to stop black from recirculating. 11/7 is a little better than 11/6 because it's less likely for black to crash his board.

Usually, you want to clear from the back. But in backgames, you want to clear the most difficult points first. The 8 point is in shooting range of both anchors but the 9 isn't. So here, it is actually better to play 8/4 8/3 even though it leaves a gap. This is known as the [[Squeeze Play]].

Another example of where the squeeze play is best. 7/4 7/3. It also means if white rolls a 6 he has to break his 1 point which he really doesn't want to do.
