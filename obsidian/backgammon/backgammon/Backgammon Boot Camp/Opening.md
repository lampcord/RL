The opening is usually considered the first 3 moves by both sides. It is a good idea to become an expert in this phase of the game because you will see it in every game you play. A sloppy mistake in the opening can give you a much weaker position than you deserve.

The basic goals in the opening are:
1) [[make points in the opening]]
2) [[Building the Prime]]
3) [[hit blots]]
If you are leading in the race you try to disengage and if you're behind you try to tie your opponent up.

With the first roll you can
1) [[make points in the opening]]
2) [[split]]
3) [[bring a builder down]]
4) [[run a back man]]
5) [[slotting]]
