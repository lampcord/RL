End contact positions arise when the two sides are on the verge of breaking contact. They all involve situations where one side's racing chances are enhanced by the possibility of hitting a blot in the next couple of rolls.

This race is dead even with black being down 4 with the roll.  There are 14 ways to hit, and 22 ways to miss. If black misses, those 22 get divided evenly and that gives white 11 chances to win. 11 is better than the nine needed to take so this is a (re)double/take.

Here, black has 17 ways to hit. However 11, 12, 13, 14, 23 all come up short giving white a counter shot. That's nine chances for white to have 11-17 hits back. White will hit about 3 of them. That leaves black with 17 hits, white with 3 and 16 leftover to be split. 25 to 11. Another (re)double/take.

Even though black is up 15 and has the roll, white gets a chance to hit with the following rolls: 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 22, 23, 24, 33, 66. That's 16 rolls and white should hit about 5-6 of these. So that's 20 rolls that get by, 5.5 that get hit leaving 11 that are race situations. That means white only has to win 3.5 out of 11 races to have a take. White is right on the line here for a take.

If there wasn't any contact, [[Isight]] would have this as 74 + 9 = 83 - 86 (black has one extra crossover) for -3. A clear double/drop. But the fact that any 1 by white means shuffling checkers in the home board without getting any closer in makes this a marginal take.
