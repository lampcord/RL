A tempo play is a play where you hit the opponent's blot and your primary intention is to not allow your opponent to use both rolls to make a strong play usually building a point.

Black can run 24/15 or slot the 20 point although that is in direct shot of 3 white checkers [[under the gun]]. If black plays passively, white has many rolls that will build points or anchors. So instead, black should play 6/1* 24/20. This denies black the ability to use 2 dice to make a constructive move while still slotting the 20 point.

Note that a 52 would not be played this way because the 24/22 split does not come [[under the gun]].

In this position black must hit. Otherwise the odds of white making a huge positional gain are just too great. Almost every roll does something productive. 6/1* is a must and 24/21 gives black's back checker [[Breathing Room]].

In this case hitting with the 5 would be a mistake. For one thing, black has no checkers to follow up with. Also, with the forward anchor, white isn't much of a threat to do anything devastating if left alone. But most importantly [[connection]]. Bar/16 makes the important connection point in the outfield which both disrupts white and helps black bring checkers forward.

A couple of minor changes make all the difference. Now white has an outfield blot that black would really like to hit. The tempo hit on 1 keeps white from having an easy time getting it to safety. Only 11, 12, 22 would allow white to come in and cover or black will get a free shot on the blot on the 10 point. In addition, if white comes in and hits, only a 5 will cover the blot on the 24 point. Bar/21 6/1*.

Black HAS to hit here. If he doesn't and with has 2 dice to play, he has devastating attacking odds and will likely win a double. This calls for the rare [[banana split]]. Bar/20 5/3*!
As crazy as this looks, if white dances, black has a probable double and even if white comes in, black still has a 4 point board a blot to hit in white's home board and the possibility of making the advanced anchor at 20.
