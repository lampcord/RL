[[Attacking Doubles]]
"We described an attacking doubles as any double based on the prospect of making positional gains while your opponent is stuck on the bar. Attacking doubles are common but hard to classify."

Some of the conditions that contribute to the strength of an attack:
1) Race Lead.
2) Degree to which back men have escaped.
3) Chances to hit additional blots.
4) Points made in and near home board.
5) Checkers available for making home board points.
6) Defender's checkers on the bar.
7) Defender's lack of an anchor.
Typical strengths for the defender:
1) A prime blocking some of the attacker's checkers.
2) Home board points.
3) Outfield points.
4) General flexibility, good distribution of builders on points.
5) An actual anchor or prospects for making one.

Author's Note: "I guarantee that to the extent you take note of them both while studying and when making decisions in your own games, your insight into positions of this type will improve."

Black has more points, more builders and fewer laggards compared to the reference position. That pushes this over the top to too good to double.

The 3 men back aren't necessarily bad because they can help build an anchor. Black has partially escaped but does not have a lot of builders in the zone. This is a double / take.

White's lead is small. No extra black blots to tempo hit so white will have to trap this one blot. Only 3 home board points. This is a little early to double and huge take.

White has only 2 points and blots all over. 6 point is still over stacked. Black's position has great potential with perfect builder distribution. He is favored to come in and may even hit. This is not yet a double and huge take.

White has a huge lead in the race so he can win either by blitzing or racing. He has the race lead, more blots to shoot at, more checkers in the zone. This is a double / pass.
