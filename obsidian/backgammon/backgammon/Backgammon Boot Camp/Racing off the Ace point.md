When both players have checkers only on their ace point, this is the simplest [[bear off]] situation in backgammon.

2 rolls vs 2 or 3 vs 3 is (re)double, drop.
4 vs 4 is both a (re)double and a take.
both same number of rolls > 5, double but not redouble, take.
If rolling player has fewer rolls than opponent it's always a redouble, drop.

These are not really pure ace point races. They are 4 rolls but 11 and 22 only take 3 and since it's an even number of checkers, they don't save a roll. Black does not need a double to win but white does so white is hurt much more by those two rolls. So this is a (re)double, drop.

Even though white is one checker further back, this is actually a take! Why? Because now 22 picks up 4 checkers instead of 3 and the two checkers that 11 pick up are effectively the same as 3 because of the even number.
