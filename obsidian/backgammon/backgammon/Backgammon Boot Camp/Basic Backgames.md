If you really want to ruin your PR, play a bunch of [[Backgame]]s. These positions are so complicated and difficult that even grandmasters make blunders in them.

Double but not redouble and an easy take. Black wins 56% with 23% doubles and 9% triples.

A few turns later and white still has great chances. 62, 52, 42 leave two shots on two blots leaving black 31 shots! Notice white willingly leaving a blot on the two. This is a critical move that leaves the chance for the double shot.

In the middlegame where your timing is shaky and you aren't still fully committed to a back game, the best anchor pair is probably 5, 2. This leaves you a lot of flexibility and pressure on his outer board with the chance to run if things go one way and at least have a 2 point anchor with possible hole on the 5 point.

During the [[Bearing In]] phase, the best 3 anchors in order are 12, 13, 23. But during the [[Bearing Off]] stage they are in opposite order: 23, 13, 12.

Here black is way too good to double! He will probably leave a shot but with no prime, it will be very difficult for white to win. It might not even get white off the gammon!

Black has killed his 6's [[Killing 6s]]. If he rolls a 6 he won't have to move. This allows him to preserve his prime with high rolls while his opponent has to keep moving forward. Initial double, no redouble.

Here black can run into disaster with rolls like 65 and 54. If black can clear the 8 point he will have killed his 6s. No double / take.

The total number of blotting rolls here is very high. 65, 54, 53, 64, 44. Two adjacent blocking points leave a lot more shots when opponent has to open because often both anchors are in range as opposed to gapped anchors. No double / beaver!
