One quick way to sum up a position is to look at the anchors of each side. Usually the player with the most advanced anchor is winning. If one side has escaped completely while the other still has an anchor, the first side is usually better off.

In fact, having escaped to safety while your opponent hasn't, combined with a 15 pip lead is usually enough to [[double]].
