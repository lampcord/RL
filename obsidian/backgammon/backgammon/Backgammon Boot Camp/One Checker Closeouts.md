A one checker closeout is a position where one player has a single checker on the bar completely closed out and otherwise there is no contact. Usually this happens when a player with one or more checkers back gets a late hit and has a full prime or board.

If black doubles here, white has a slight take. Shift those checkers to the 2,3,4 position and it's a slight drop. This is because it's more likely in the first position that white will be able to pick up a couple of checkers before having to break his board.

Now the position has switched and it is the shutting out player on the roll. This is a (re)double and a slight drop. If you just move a white checker from the 3 point to the 1 point, it's a take.

A good rule of thumb is (re)double when you have five fewer men off and your opponent is still on the bar. This position is an example of that. So for example if white had one more man off, black would wait a turn but then if he rolled 65, taking two checkers off he could double next turn.

Black has 4 fewer and white is on the bar. This is a double/take.

If black just plays normally here he is a heavy underdog. The best move is to pick up a 2 and 3, hope he gets hit and picks up the other checker! It's a long shot but if he does he has a real chance.
