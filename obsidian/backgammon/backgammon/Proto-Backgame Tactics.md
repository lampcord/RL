Black plays bar/23 24/20 to make an [[Advanced Anchor]]. Then he its wit 6/4*. He is trying to get hit since he is so far behind and trying to do it in a way that sends him back the maximum amount.

In with the 5 and then 11/5*. Again maximizing potential race loss.

15/11 6/3*. Making the 11 point blocks black's advanced anchor making it harder to recirculate and hitting on 3 allows him to drop back in the race as well and possibly takes a key point from the 23 best backgame position. Passive play could still backfire as it's not too late for black to play forward.

Black plays bar/22 23/22. Still hoping for the 23 backgame but with a fallback of a 35 if white takes the 2 point.
