Skillful attacking play scores more points and wins more matches than any other phase of backgammon strategy.
![[Blitzing]]
Attacking strategy emphasizes hitting blots and building home board points while neglecting other things like running, anchors and even safety.

The best play by far here is the double hit 8/4* 6/1*. Even though white has 22 ways to hit one blot he only has 3 ways to hit both and 11 ways to bring in 0 or 1 leaving black a great chance to make a board point with the unhit slotter. Meanwhile, if black is hit, white is also vulnerable with his own blot on the bar point. If white has a weak roll like 62, black can already double!

With 2 men on the bar, black's primary objective is to stop white from making an anchor. If he can't hit as in this position, he needs to bring as many attackers into range as possible. So 13/9 13/10 is the best play here even though it leaves 6 blots. Of course there is the 2/36 chance that white rolls 3s or 4s which would be very dangerous but you can't let 1 or 2 jokers stop you from making the best play.

This position has some important differences with the previous. White has only 1 man on the bar instead of 2, black has made only 3 points instead of 4, and white has started building a home board with some builders. 8/5* is still automatic. But instead of bringing down another builder with 13/11, splitting with 24/22 is slightly better (-0.028). Notice that splitting also leaves a direct shot on the 16 blot.
