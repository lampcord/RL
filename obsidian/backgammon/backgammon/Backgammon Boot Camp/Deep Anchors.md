Deep Anchors (1 and 2 points) usually mean giving up on the race and playing for a late shot. This is why it's so important to try to build [[Advanced Anchor]] in the [[Opening]] because they allow for so much more flexibility.
However, a deep anchor still stops your opponent from shutting you out and therefore is a huge asset to stop your opponent from [[Blitzing]] you.
