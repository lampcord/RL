When all the checkers are in your home board, you are in the final stage. Bearing off.

Doubling advice:

1) In a long bear off (40 pips or more) the 8, 9, 12 rule applies. [[The Race]]
2) In short bear offs (30 pips or less) being even is probably a double and a take unless very short then a drop.
3) With just a couple left, count the actual number of rolls that bear off.

Notes:

When only one roll remains, count the number of rolls that bear off. If it's more than half, it's a double. 

First rule of bear offs:
Always bear off checkers with a single dice if you can.

A two roll position is a double / pass.

A three roll position is a double / pass.

A four roll position is a double and small take.

A five roll position isn't even a redouble, it's a double only and a solid take.

If you can bear off checkers with both parts of your roll, do it.

If you can only bear off with 1 dice, use the other to fill a gap. If you have a choice of gaps, choose the higher one.

Remember, your roll comes in two parts. Make sure to optimize filling gaps by looking at all options when you can't take 2 off.

If you can only take off a checker by using both halves of the roll and doing so leaves you with an awkward position, it might be better to smooth it out.

Here the obvious 5/O is correct because the position is still smooth.

This is different. Not 5/O leaves a stack and a gap. The right move here is 6/3 4/2! Note that 5/O is only a .010 error. But every bit helps.

When both sides have the same or very similar positions and you are down to 25-30 pips, having the dice is a double and usually a clear take.
