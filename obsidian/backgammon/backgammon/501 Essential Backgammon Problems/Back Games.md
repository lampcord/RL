When you have two or more anchors and you are way behind, you are in a back game.

You should not seek out a back game, it is a last ditch effort to save a bad game.

Tips against a back game:

1) Build a prime against the anchors. You want to crunch his board before you have to open.
2) Three point back games are very strong. Play very aggressively to stop your opponent from getting his third anchor.
3) When bearing in, clear from the back.

Tips when you have the back game:

1) Look for opportunities to break out and go forward by hitting.
2) If you have 2 or 3 anchors and your opponent hasn't built a prime, slot freely. Don't worry about getting more checkers sent back.
3) If you have spares on an anchor, your top priority is recirculating them back in.

Notes:

Don't be afraid to stick your opponent in a back game. If you win it could be a double or triple. If you lose it will almost always be a single.

Blocking points are the key to defeating a back game. Make your opponent play his big rolls in his home board.

Don't volunteer a direct shot if your opponent's position is about to crumble.

Don't let your opponent establish a second anchor if possible.

Leaving a blot in your home board when your opponent is on the bar is a great trick against a back game as long as he doesn't have a prime of his own. If he is forced to hit you, you can recirculate your checker and wreck his timing.

Clear from the rear. *A point cleared is a point not to be feared*.

However, the exception is when you have a choice between two points to clear, if one of them only has a shot from one of your opponent's anchors and the other a direct shot from both, clear the one that can be hit from both. That way if you are forced to open the other point, he has half as many shots.

Don't strip points if there is a possibility of attacking inside. Pointing on one of your opponent's blots left from an anchor or a pick and pass can be a great play.

Basic rules for bearing off:

1) Clear from the rear.
2) When you can't, strip the rear point.
3) Keep spares on your inner points.

When your opponent's back game has collapsed, try to squeeze out as much as you can and play for a gammon or even backgammon.

Don't be in a hurry to clear points if you have a shot at a gammon.

When you have a terrible game but only one anchor, it's worth a big risk to get that second anchor.

The first rule of playing a back game is preserve your timing.

If you can't leap a spare, make sure they are on anchors that have a clear shot to escape.

Getting trapped spares into the outfield guarantees more timing whether they are hit or not.

If you are stuck in a bad back game, look for a chance to bail and save the double.

If you are in a back game that can't be primed, try to win by going forward first.

If you are playing a back game with bad timing, don't slow your opponent down by hitting him. Let him play his full roll. He might roll big doubles and help your timing.

When it's time to leave your back game points, leave from the front point.

Remember that to win a back game you have to hit *and* contain.

Beware of doubling a back game too quickly.

If your opponent has a well-timed back game, threats to hit are not threats at all.

Don't double if you can't lose your market.

The 1-5 back game isn't very good. It plays out like an ace point game except the opponent doesn't have to bother to clear his 5.
