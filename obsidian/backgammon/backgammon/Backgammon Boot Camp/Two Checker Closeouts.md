Two Checker Closeouts as the name would suggest are just like [[One Checker Closeouts]] but with two on the bar.

Black will win about 68% in this position but should not even give a double. Why? Because black only loses his market with 66 and having white dance. The only way this is a double is if black clears all of his spares. If black clears his 6 and takes off two then it is a double. If we add just one checker for white at the 24 point, this is a double/take. Two checkers and it's a double/drop. If we add a third checker it's a solid drop unless black has the worst possible spare configuration: 2 on the 1 and 1 on the 6.
