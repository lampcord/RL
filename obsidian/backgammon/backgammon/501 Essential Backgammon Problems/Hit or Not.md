Many tactical choices come down to whether and where to hit. What if you can hit or make a point, or improve distribution or hop over a prime?

In general, hitting is best because it gains in the race and takes away one of your opponent's numbers on the next turn.

Exceptions:

1) If you can hit in the outfield or make an inner board point, usually the inner board point is preferred. 
2) If hitting leaves your opponent with lots of targets you probably want to avoid hitting.
3) If your position is stacked or awkward, you may choose a developing move instead.
4) If you can hit or fill in a key priming point, the priming point is probably better.

Notes:

Don't be afraid to hit lose if you are probably going to lose anyway if you play safe.

When you already have a bunch of blots lying around, consolidation is probably better than hitting.

In a priming battle, it is often better to build the prime than send another checker back.

Be careful of hitting when your opponent's position is on the brink of breaking down. Putting a man on the bar might allow him to survive a little longer.

Beware of hitting if you have a racing lead and the hit will make it very difficult to consolidate your lead.
