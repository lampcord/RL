This is when you've been playing back for a hit, got the hit and shutout the checker.

Tips:

1) You can start thinking about doubling when you have 5 less men borne off than your opponent.
2) If you are way behind, you may have to bear off aggressively leaving gaps or even blots in order to be close enough that the other checker can't race around and pick up before you.

This is the ideal doubling point. White has 5 more checkers off than black. Black has white on the bar, shut out and the perfect bearing off position.

Normally, 5 checkers behind with a fast bear off or 4 checkers behind with a slow bear off is the double take point.

As you get closer to the end, the 5 checker difference is even more powerful. 15 to 10 is right on the edge but 12 to 7 is still a take but a much closer take.

Here is how you evaluate this type of position:
1) Count the number of crossovers for each side. Black has 13, white has 4 + 5 for the checker on the bar to get around and bear off..
2) If black trails by 4 or more checkers, take 2 off. If black trails by 2 or less, play safe. If by 3, it's a tossup.

When you own the cube you avoid high volatility plays where a good roll by your opponent could make your cube useless. So you are more likely to play safe when it's a tossup.

If you get a shot at a second checker, it is not an automatic double. First make sure you have a winning game even if you miss.

Beware of taking cubes when you need to hit a shot to have a chance and you will lose a double if you don't.
