You would like to offer a double when your winning chances are 68-69% and redouble when it's 71-72%.

Basic questions:

1) Do I have a better position?
		Ahead?
		More blocking points?
		Back checkers more advanced?
		Opponent on the bar?
2) Am I threatening to do something decisive or crushing on the next roll?

If you wait till you get the killer roll, you have lost your market.

If you think you are more than twice as likely to win a gammon as to lose the game, you should not double. Play on.
