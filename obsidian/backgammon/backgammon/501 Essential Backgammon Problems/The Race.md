When all contact is broken, you are in a pure race.

Powerful rule:

1) Count your pips and then your opponents. If your lead is at least 8% you can double, if it's at least 9% you can redouble.
2) If you are doubled and you trail by more than 12%, pass. Otherwise take.

Notes:

In long races, try to arrange your men evenly across the 4,5,6 points.

The ideal position for bearing off is a triangle with 5 checkers on the 6 counting down to the 1.

When racing home, use aces to fill in gaps in your home board not to limp around a little further.
