When one or both players have built primes, the game becomes very complex. Both sides need to balance blocking their opponent in while escaping their own checkers.

Guidelines:
1) The main goal is to build a 6 prime. This will usually win the game unless opponent also has built one.
2) Once you have built a 6 prime, roll it forward.
3) When you have a choice between priming and escaping, do what is harder first.
4) If your opponent breaks his anchor, look for opportunities to convert a priming game to a blitz.

Notes:

Attack the edge of the prime. Do not let your opponent slot there for a forward anchor.

In general, build the prime first, then escape.

When rolling in a prime, pay attention to how strong your opponent's board is.

Always a good rule: Do what's difficult to do first, try to make your opponent do what is difficult for him.

Give maximum attention to variations that make a full 6 prime possible.

A strong position with no risk is better than a chance at a won position with risk.

Always pay attention to racing. 

Be alert to doubling possibilities when their is a great chance of a gammon.
