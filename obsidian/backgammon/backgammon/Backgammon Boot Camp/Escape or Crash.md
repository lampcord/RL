If you have a position where the first player to roll a 6 wins, the first player has the advantage. It's about 59%.
![[position_000103.png]]
This is the same position from [[Prime vs. Prime]]. Since there is a 59% chance that black rolls a 6 first and even not rolling a 6 could lead to a closeout and a later 6, black must be slightly better than 59% to win (actually 63.7%).

1) Any 6 wins immediately.
2) 55, 44, 33 will crash his board and make him less than 41%.
3) The other 22 rolls make him slightly worse than 59% because of his weaker home board.
Those 11 sixes are huge market losers making this a huge (re)double and a take.

This is a very common type of position. Black needs to escape and white is on the bar against a 3 1/2 point board. White's board is optimal, black's 4 point is stripped meaning any 3 but 63 will force him to give it up or even leave a blot. This is a (re)double/take but black will often drop here which is a steal for white.

Some of black's wins will follow a crash. At least 30%. The key is only 33, 44, 55 break the board. Its a double and very narrow drop.

Now just moving the checker from 5 to 3 changes things a lot. Now we can add 54, 53, 43, 22. Another 7 rolls. And 44 leaves a blot. (Re)double / take.
![[position_000108.png]]
In this case when black gets a 6 he will have to move his checker forward pretty quickly instead of waiting around for a hit. He has about a 1/3 chance of hitting before that. Since black re entering on the 1 point is almost as bad as dancing, it doesn't change things much that everything was shifted. Double and comfortable take.

This is much different than the others because now the escape roll is a 5 eliminates a bunch of bad rolls for black. A 6 here is simply dead. This is a clear double / pass.
![[position_000110.png]]
The anchor also makes a big difference. In other positions black either escapes or hits. In this one he escapes or moves closer to crashing. double and big take.
