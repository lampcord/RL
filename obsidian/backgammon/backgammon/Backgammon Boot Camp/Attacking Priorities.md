The basic strategy of attacking is simple. Hit blots, make home board points and when you've done all you can, bring the rest of the checkers around and win.

But what about priorities?
In general:
1) Make home board points.
2) Hitting blots.
3) Bring stragglers home.
But there are exceptions.
For example, home board points and blots each have diminishing returns. If you've made 4 points but only have 1 opponent checker back, you gain more by hitting another checker than making another point. But if you had 3 of his checkers back, but no board points, it would be much better to build your home board than send more back.

The correct play here is Bar/23 24/22 6/4(2). However it is only a 0.003 error to play Bar/23 22/16*. Hitting instead of building. This is because black already has a better home board but only 1 white checker back.

This is the obvious 8/3* 6/3. Hitting the 16 blot and the 3 blot risks everything on being missed. Giving up a forward anchor not worth the risk.

This is a mutual attacking position. Initiative is huge. Also, black is way behind and can't just let white have a free escape roll from the edge of his prime. Hitting with the 5 is a must 8/3*. That leaves 24/18 for the 6 which not only gives black mobility but also a chance to pick up another checker. If black makes the bar point instead, white will escape with a 6 or hit the blot on the one or possibly both.

Hit blots, make points. 18/16* 7/2. The 16 blot in particular is a great builder. Not hitting it almost guarantees white building a good point and equalizing the board. Note hitting the 1 blot instead is only a (0.011) mistake.

Black should just run his back checker to 16.  If he played 24/21 13/8 to protect against 4s it's a lost cause because his 21 blot still gets crushed with a point and it's virtually game over. In the real game, black played the correct 24/16. And white rolled.... 44! Ouch.
