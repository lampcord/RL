Walter Trice breaks backgammon down and puts it back together. Backgammon Boot Camp is for anyone wishing to get real good, real quick. The next three hundred pages contain more clear, concise, and essential information on every aspect of the game than has ever before appeared in one volume. Accessible to beginners; essential for experts.

I really liked this book. Covers a little bit of everything including the mental game. Some of the match play stuff is above my level.
