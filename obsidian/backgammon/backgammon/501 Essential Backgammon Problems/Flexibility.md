Flexibility is placing checkers so more of your future rolls will be good and more of your opponent's future rolls will be bad.

This can be broken down into 4 principles:
1) Diversification - placing your checkers so they will have the most possible ways to build a key point.
2) Unstacking - huge stacks mean a lot of checkers doing the work of a few. Unstacking is a key to building a stronger position.
3) Duplication - making rolls that are good for your opponent in one area also good in another. This limits the number of good rolls and forces him to make a choice when they get one of those rolls.
4) Slotting - putting a checker on a point you intend to make with the idea of covering it on the next turn.

Notes:

Points are good but look around to see if your checkers are better off spread out.

When breaking your prime, look to see if you can put maximum pressure on opponent by leaving as many places to hit from as possible.

The more awkward your position, the more points you have to sacrifice for flexibility.

Big stacks lead to big problems. Get those checkers into play as quickly as possible.

Duplication often allows you to find the safest play quickly without having to count shots.

As much as possible, try to give yourself different numbers for different objectives.

If your opponent has a number that is very strong, you can gain a lot by duplicating it elsewhere.

If your opponent escapes your home board, your goal is to build it up as quickly as possible preparing for a hit.

In general, you don't want to slot when your back checkers are split.  If your opponent misses your slotted checker, he may hit one of your split checkers making it much harder for you to cover your slot.

Once you have escaped completely, don't play too boldly. You don't want to get sent back again if possible.
