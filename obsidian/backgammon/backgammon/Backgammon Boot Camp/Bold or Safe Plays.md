This is from Paul Magriel's famous book.

1) Opponent's board strength. The more points he has, the safer you play.
2) If you have an anchor, you can afford being hit so you can play bolder.
3) Your own board strength. The more points you have the more bold you can play.
4) Blots in opponent's board means if you get hit you have a shot to hit back. Bolder.
5) Number of men you have back. The more you have back, the less you mind one more. Bolder.
6) Number your opponent has back. The more he has back the less value in hitting more. Safer*.

Hitting is only a subset of bold plays. Boldness can also be a play that leaves blots open for positional gains like controlling the [[outfield]] or [[connection]] or [[slotting]].

A modern addendum is:
7) *The more men your opponent has back the freer you are to abandon anchors and leave blots. This somewhat corrects (6) because while you don't want to hit as much you still can otherwise play bold.
