[[General Principles]]
Playing backgammon is like driving a car. Most of the time it's routine, but you have to pay attention because you never know when something will jump out in front of you.

The most substantial errors you will ever make will come from lapses in attention. And they will come in appallingly simple positions.

Develop an attitude of engagement in backgammon. Look at the whole board, pay attention and take note of significant features.

There is also a tendency to make mistakes in unfamiliar positions. This can often occur when playing a beginner. They make a bad move like abandoning the 6 point for no reason (happened to me) and you're not sure how to make them pay for it. The mere fact that the position is unfamiliar should be a red flag for careful deliberate play.
