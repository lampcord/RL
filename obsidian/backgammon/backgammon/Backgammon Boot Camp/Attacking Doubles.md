Successful attacking leads to quick and large increases in equity. Which means the best time to double is right before a successful attack because after often means losing your equity.

This is an example of black waiting probably 1 turn too long. Black's equity is actually 1.078 so this is too good to double. White should be happy to walk away for only 1 point. If white gets shut out, all of those outboard checkers will make a double extremely likely. Black has a 48.8% chance of a gammon here!

This looks like an avalanche is about to fall on black's head. but that anchor for black means he won't get shutout. White needs to do a little more work before its right to double. But it's only a tiny error (-0.010) and in the real game his opponent passed which was a 0.404 megablunder!

Black has the 5 point, a 24 pip lead and both back men out with a good chance of securing them this turn. This is a clear double. With 4 men back and no advanced anchor, white should pass.

One checker behind a 4 prime vs. 2 behind a 3 prime is about a push. White is a little behind but if he hits will have a big edge with the second checker back. This is not quite a double yet but if white did, it would only be a small error (-0.022).

White has small edges everywhere. Better board. Better prime. 19 pips ahead, black on the bar, And white's back checkers have made a lot of progress and are in range of black's 14 blot. This is so good for white it's almost too good. This is a tiny double and massive (0.446) pass.
Even though this is a tiny (0.001) error to not double it is a HUGE practical error. Since none of white's individual advantages are obvious, a lot of players will take here.
