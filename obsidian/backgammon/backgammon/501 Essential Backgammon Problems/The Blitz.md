Blitzes are characterized by big swings of fortune and lots of gammons.

Features:

1) How many home board points does the attacker have?
		Doubling with 2 is rare.
		Doubling with 3 is usually strong with a take.
		Doubling with 4 is usually a pass.
2) How many checkers on the bar?
		One checker is typical.
		Two on the bar is usually a pass.
3) How many vulnerable blots does the blitzed player have?
		One is tolerable.
		Two or more is usually a pass.
4) How many builders does the blitzer have?
5) How many points does the defender have in his home board?
		Even one extra point can greatly increase his chances.

Notes:

Even a two point board can lead to a winning blitz if defender is weak enough.

Two on the bar usually means double / pass.

Two on the bar against a 3 point board is a good double even if the rest of the position is weak.

Once a blitz has started, it usually is best to keep going at the expense of everything else until you shut out your opponent, or he gets an anchor.

The tough choices are those between making a point or hitting loose.

Two key ideas when blitzing:
1) You really need to cover blots in your board.
2) Low points may be just as good or better than high points. Your high points are closer to your builders and give more pick and pass plays when bearing in.

Making points quickly is the key to a successful blitz.

Once your checkers have escaped, you don't need to overplay the blitz. You can pick and pass or just go past him to bear off.

When a blitz runs cold, revert to standard positional play. This could mean an anchor or running out of builders.

Once your opponent has anchored, there is very little value on attacking deep points.

Picking up loose blots of your opponent is more valuable than bringing down builders.

In the later stages, don't overplay and throw away all you have gained.

The more checkers you have back the more important a quick closeout becomes.

Repair the weakest part of your position first.

At the end of a successful blitz you need to balance attacking and escaping.

When you are under attack, clean up your loose blots while you can. Once the blitz starts, you may not get the chance.
