Usually when bearing in, the primary goal is to not leave a blot. However, this must be balanced with the goal of not allowing your opponent to make an anchor if possible.

In this position, the play is 7/1* 18/14. Even though black is breaking his prime, it is worth the risk because if he gets the closeout, it is practically a guaranteed double with all of the white checkers in the [[outfield]]. If white anchors, he has a [[Well Timed Position]] and [[Anchors]]. Black is still favored to win but only a 20% chance at a gammon.
