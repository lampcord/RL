[[Prime vs. Prime]]
One of the hardest problems in prime vs prime games is when you get a roll that can be used either the help your back men or your prime. Often it comes down to the specific die roll and which goal it does more effectively.

The choices here are to split and bring one down or slot the 5. White has a better board making the slot dangerous. [[Bold or Safe Plays]]. And since white has made his bar point but abandoned his 8 point the slotting move 24/23 is called for. It has daylight so it puts pressure on white's out board, makes it easier to advance the anchor and can escape from there. And white only has 9 checkers and is mostly stripped of builders so this may be the last chance. 13/8 is more or less forced but it does unstack and bring a builder down safely.

This is a similar situation. Slotting the 4 makes no sense because white has nothing to cover it. Black has only 9 in the box so splitting is still fairly safe. And if black can't cover, white now has two shots at the 5 point. Best is 24/23 24/22 but 13/11 24/23 is almost as good.

Here is a real choice between making the 4 point and moving up to the 3 anchor. It turns out that making the 4 point is much better. This is because of how much it improves white's position from a glorified 3 point board to a perfect 5 point board. However 24 rolls allow black to make his own 5 prime with better timing which makes grabbing the 4 point tempting.

The 2 is automatic. 6/4*. It knocks white's checker off the edge of the prime. Black can't allow white to make the 4 anchor. It also slots the 4 which means if white misses black has a chance at a very solid 5 prime. And it acts as a tempo play as white has a lot of builders that could make the bar or 4 point on his side. The 5 is 13/8 which brings a potential builder for the 4 point. Plus it's more or less forced.
