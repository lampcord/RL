[[Attacking Doubles]]
[[Attacking Doubles II]]
Backgammon is not a game for players wanting all of their knowledge neatly classified and arranged. The most successful students are the ones who directly tackle the positions that give them difficulty as they come up. But the study of recorded expert play is almost as effective in the long run, and it brings the added benefit of being able to see how the top players handle themselves in all phases of the game.

White has real advantages in [[PRAT]].  This is a double / take but only a take by (0.090). If white had the 5 instead of the 3 it would be a clear drop.

31 rolls give black a 5th point or a second blot. Big double and huge drop.
![[position_000133.png]]
Black is way ahead, has a better board, established a 5 anchor and has a ton of ways to hit and make points. Clear double / drop.

White leading 22:17 race to 25.
White has position and threat but not race. In a money game this would be a clear double / take.

Generally don't double a contact position where your opponent doesn't have an anchor when you have a big lead in a match. Only double if you are putting your opponent in a serious decision about a take. Here if black takes as he should and things go a little sour for white, black could double back and possibly win the match from 8 behind with a gammon!

Black trailing 17:23 to 25
This is not normally a doubling position. Black has position but not the lead and no real threat with only 8 in the zone. But because of the match score, black doubled and white dropped.

Black on roll trailing 18:23 to 25
Black has position, slight lead in the race, threatens to make another point, hit or slot with white on the bar. This would be a double / take for money but at this match score it's a clear drop.
