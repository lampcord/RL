Duplication is a technique of minimizing your opponent's shots by leaving blots the same number away from opponents checkers so the same die number will hit both.

Here black has to play 16/10. That is forced. The question is what to do with the 2? If he plays the two either 16/14 or 10/8 then white has direct shots with either a 3 or a 1. That's 20 direct shots plus some indirect. If instead he plays 5/3 he leaves one blot 3 away from the 13 point and the 7 point. That is now only 11 shots plus indirect shots. This is what duplication is about, minimizing your opponents good rolls by duplicating them.

Similarly, 51 would be played 16/10 instead of 16/11 and moving the 1 elsewhere.

The opposite of duplication is [[Diversification]].
