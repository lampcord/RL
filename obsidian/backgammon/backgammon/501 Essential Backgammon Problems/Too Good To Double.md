In most clubs, the [[Jacoby Rule]] is considered to always be in force for money games and chouettes. 

Once the cube has been played, make sure not to let your opponent off the hook with a pass when a gammon is likely.

Pointers:

1) If your opponent is trapped behind a 6 prime and you can't lose, play on. He will just pass anyway and if you keep playing his position might get bad enough to win a gammon.
2) If your game is strong but there are losing chances, try to evaluate the likelihood of a loss. If it is about 20%, it's probably a good time to cash the game.
3) If you own the cube and you're playing for gammon, stay away from risky plays that would keep you from using the cube if things go wrong.
