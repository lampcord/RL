A back game is when one player has 2 and sometimes 3 anchors back with the intention of building a solid prime and hitting their opponent to turn the game around.  If the back game player loses, he often loses a double. Often the hit only serves to save the double. But sometimes because of a bad run early it is the only chance to win.
