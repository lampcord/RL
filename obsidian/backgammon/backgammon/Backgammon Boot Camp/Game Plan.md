When we talk about planning in backgammon, it's not like chess. There are no long term detailed plans. Instead we have different game plans.
There are really only 3 ways to win a game in backgammon:
1) [[Racing]]
2) [[Priming]]
3) [[Blitzing]]

This is according to [[Backgammon Boot Camp]], but modern backgammon theory adds a fourth one:
4) [[Backgammon Boot Camp/Holding Games]]

Formulating a game plan involves ranking the possible game plans in order of which one is most feasible for a win. For example, if you are 40 pips up but have no prime at all, Racing is a much better game plan than priming.

Once you've identified your best plan, you identify your subgoals and components and work back to the most important near term tasks.

Racing is not good because Black is behind. Priming is possible but if black doesn't make the 9 point in the next few rolls, White has a good chance to escape and is ahead. This leaves attacking. Black has 10 [[men in the zone]] and even though he doesn't have a board, it could fill in quickly and he has more potential builders nearby. The best move here is bar/20 6/3*.

In general, with one opponent back you attack and with 2 back you prime because you have more time to build the prime with 2 back and your opponent can't make an anchor with 1 back.
