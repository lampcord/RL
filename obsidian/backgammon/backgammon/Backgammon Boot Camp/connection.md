Keeping all of your checkers within 6 pips of each other. This allows you to use forward checkers as safe landing zones for checkers behind them. Some people think this is the single most important concept in the opening and why so many great players like to split and make forward anchors.

The best play here is 22/16. Making the 16 point to keep the back checkers connected to the 16 point is so important that nothing else is even worth considering. The 3 is played 6/3* mostly because there is simply no other good 3.

If black were instead to play the *obvious* and safe 16/7 it would be a huge blunder as the back checkers would be completely isolated from the front and black does not have a  [[Well Timed Position]] needed for a [[Backgame]].

In addition to making his own position connected, the 16 point also puts pressure on the [[outfield]] making it harder for white to bring his checkers home.

Here the correct play is 24/18 13/11. This is because the [[home board]] point made by white makes it even more important that black try to connect his back checkers with the [[midpoint]].

After 24/18, every one of black's checkers are within 6 points of each other.

The rather surprising correct play here is 24/18 6/5. Again, black aims to connect his back checkers and the normal 13/7 8/7 is bad because it abandons the 8 point and leaves a direct shot.

However, there is another play. The [[Blitzing]] play 8/2* 2/1* doesn't win as many games but wins more gammons.

Often the best play from a connection point of view is to simply grab the furthest back checker and move it forward. Bar/21 24/18. Black has a lot of blots but with 2 anchors and 3 white checkers back it's not that scary to get hit.
