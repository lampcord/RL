When there are potentially two rolls remaining to [[bear off]], this is a two roll bearoff position.
The odds can be calculated by the number of rolls that win now

For white to figure out his odds of winning, he multiplies the odds of black NOT winning on the next roll times the odds of white winning if black fails. Black fails on 19 rolls. Any 1 or 2 == 20 - 1 because 22 will still win. White then wins on the remaining 17 rolls. 

This means chances are (19 x 17) / (36 x 36)

18 x 18 = 324 which is 25% of 36 x 36 == 1296.

25% is the break even point for a take in a money game.

Since (X + N) x (X - N) is X^2 - N^2 we see that 19 x 17 has to be < 18 x 18 and therefore this is a drop.

This position is slightly different. Again it is 19 rolls that won't pick up but black is not guaranteed to win in 2 rolls. He could roll 21 twice! This would happen 4 times out of 1296. But since about half the time after the first one it won't matter because white will already have picked up, it counts as 2 more winning rolls for white pushing it to 385 or just slightly higher than 25%. This is a very narrow take.

![[position_000035.png]]
Both positions bear off with 23 rolls. White's chances are 13 x 23 which is (18 -5) x (18 + 5) or 384 - 25. Way under the take point. This is a solid pass.
