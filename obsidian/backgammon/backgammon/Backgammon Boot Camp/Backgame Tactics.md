Most people think the reason that a [[Backgame]] is a bad scenario to be in is because when you lose you tend to lose a double. But the real problem with a backgame is that it tends to bust. It's very difficult to get far enough back for your prime to hold and when it crashes often the best you can hope for is to lose a single. And the worst is to lose a triple.

Middlegame positions that have the potential to turn into backgames are called [[Proto-Backgames]].
