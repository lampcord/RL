This is a [[Well Timed Position]]. Black's checkers are far enough back that he probably won't have to break his prime by the time he gets a shot especially if he stays on the bar a few turns or is able to [[Recirculate]] his checker.

White wants to [[bear off]] safely without leaving a shot. It is best to [[clear from the rear]] and try to leave a lot of spares on points that are not ready to be cleared yet.

This wave-like shape is ideal.

Black should concentrate on getting ready for the hit by using any moves he has to recirculate and build his prime. If he can trap white behind his prime he may be forced to collapse his home board.

If black rolls 11 he's screwed. Any other roll and he should break his anchor and leave 1 back. This would mean that if white were then to roll a 1, he would have to hit and leave two shots for black.

If black traps only 1 checker he's a 5-1 underdog but if he can trap 2 he's a 2-1 favorite! Therefore, he should hit with the 2 and play 6/1 leaving a second blot. He is hoping white comes in and hits so he can pickup the other checker.

Black should NOT complete the prime here. Instead he should play 19/14 7/5 making sure that if white gets out he hits one of blacks checkers which will recirculate and then black will attempt to close white out.
