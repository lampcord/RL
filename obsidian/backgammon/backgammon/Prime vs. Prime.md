Most experts will tell you the most difficult games to play are prime vs. prime. Which means if you are facing a much better player, you should try to avoid these and vice versa.

When both sides have primes, the side that lasts longer has the advantage as his opponent will likely break first. If that happens and the first player hits or escapes it is often a winning edge.

Black being on roll here is at a huge disadvantage. (-0.355). Black's only real hope here is 66, 61, 62 as sixes are a dead number. This would flip the game around completely for black.

Here black is at a huge advantage. Rolling a 6 is essentially winning as white will continue to crunch his board while black brings around his back checker. Even worse would be if white were forced to hit black and black were to dance. Time is on black's side. This is a huge double and solid take.

The seemingly obvious play, 3/2* 2/1 would be suicide here. Black would dance and white would eventually break. Instead, white should start rolling back his prime with 6/5 6/4. It's going to break eventually anyway and now both 6s and 5s are dead which is exactly what white wants while black brings his checkers around. White has a good chance of preserving a 4 prime.

If black were to roll a couple of quick 6s this is a likely gammon. But if black were to instead double white, white should [[Beaver]]! Any 6 saves black (11 rolls). 11, 12, 13, 14, 23 (9 rolls) allow black to hold on to his prime but at that point he's even worse off. 16 rolls break black's board and then white is a heavy favorite.

This game is roughly even because rolling a 6 is a mixed blessing. If black were to roll a 63 for example he would have to run out. If white then rolls the same, he would run and hit. White would then be a 60/40 favorite. If black fans, it's a double/pass for white.

This game is advantage black. All rolls either leap the prime, hit white or both. If black escapes only on say a 61, and white doesn't escape, that would be the time to double. Before the game is wrapped up with a closeout.
